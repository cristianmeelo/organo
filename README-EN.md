## 📚 More tutorial information

Organo is a prototype of an application to manage teams and collaborators, developed from the [React: how the components work](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/react-componentes-funcionam) course. Taking this react course I was able to:

- Learn how to clone an existing project on GitHub, install the necessary dependencies and run the code;
- Understand what dependencies are and how to install new dependencies;
- Compare how React sees a component, as well as its props and states;
- Make changes to the code, such as creating new features and refactoring existing code;
- Know what one-way data binding is, and what it has to do with VirtualDOM (and why React is made this way)

The teaching is exceptional, and contributed a lot to my more abstract understanding of how React works, and I am more and more in love with it.
