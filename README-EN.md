# Organo

Organo is a prototype of an application to manage teams and collaborators.

## üî® Project features

Organo is a team and collaborator manager prototype. In it, you can create teams, define edit colors for each team, add and delete collaborators to the teams, and even favorite them! This project emphasizes componentization, in addition to working with forms, it explores the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan application and development of the input type `color`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

Check out this list of everything we will use in this app:

- `React`
- `Create React App`
- `JavaScript`
- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `GitHub`

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and run the project

To open and run the project, run `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to start the project.

Then go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser.

- **Create Team** : To create a team, fill in the name, choose a color for the team and click on `Create a new Team`, when you have a collaborator added, it will be displayed;
- **Change Team Color** : To change the color of a team, just use the `picker-color` positioned at the top right of the team section.
- **Create Collaborator** : To create a collaborator, fill in the name, position, enter an image address and choose a team for the collaborator;
- **Delete Collaborator** : To delete a collaborator, click on the icon represented by an X on the upper border of the collaborator's card, he will be automatically removed from the team and excluded from the platform;
- **Favorite Collaborator** : To favorite a collaborator, click on the icon represented by a heart just below the collaborator's job description on your card.

## üìö More tutorial information

Organo is a prototype of an application to manage teams and collaborators, developed from the [React: how the components work](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/react-componentes-funcionam) course. Taking this react course I was able to:

- Learn how to clone an existing project on GitHub, install the necessary dependencies and run the code;
- Understand what dependencies are and how to install new dependencies;
- Compare how React sees a component, as well as its props and states;
- Make changes to the code, such as creating new features and refactoring existing code;
- Know what one-way data binding is, and what it has to do with VirtualDOM (and why React is made this way)

The teaching is exceptional, and contributed a lot to my more abstract understanding of how React works, and I am more and more in love with it.
